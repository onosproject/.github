This project establishes a microservices-based redesign of ONOS-classic, called µONOS,
which serves as the SDN platform for SD-RAN and Aether's Runtime Management Plane. Read an
[overview of the project motivation, key components, and general structure](https://github.com/onosproject/.github/blob/master/profile/overview.md) 
of the µONOS platform. To learn more about how µONOS is used in Aether, visit its project [Wiki Page](https://wiki.aetherproject.org). 

If you are interested in ONOS-Classic, you'll find source code at https://gerrit.onosproject.org, with a read-only mirror 
available at https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos.
